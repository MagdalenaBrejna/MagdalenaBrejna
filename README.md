        I'm student of Applied Computer Science at the Computer Science and Telecommunication department of Wroc≈Çaw 
        University of Science and Technology, software developer in the Project Scorpio and member of the program
        for gifted students PWr. 
 
        I love innovative, creative  and out-of-the-box solutions that make a difference and solve real problems. 
        In my Java and C++ projects I pay attention to details and dont't compromise on quality. I'm passionate 
        about good films, travells and water sports like sailing.
